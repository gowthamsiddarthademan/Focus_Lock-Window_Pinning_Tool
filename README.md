Creating a tool like **Focus Lock** involves a straightforward process of scripting, functionality testing, and making the tool accessible as an executable file. Focus Lock is a Python-based utility designed to keep a selected window always on top of other applications. It operates dynamically, ensuring the pinned window stays visible regardless of switching between tasks. This concept is similar to DeskPins but implemented programmatically, making it a versatile and customizable option for developers and users. Below is a detailed explanation of the process and the steps to convert the script into an executable file.  

### Process Overview  
1. **Development and Dependencies:**  
   The core script uses Python's `pywin32` module to interact with Windows' window management API. It identifies active windows, allows users to select one, and programmatically sets it as "always on top."  

2. **Functionality Testing:**  
   During testing, the script dynamically maintains the selected window’s focus and ensures smooth interaction even when other applications are in use.  

3. **Executable Conversion:**  
   To make the tool accessible without requiring Python installation, the script is converted into a standalone executable file using PyInstaller.

### Steps to Create an Executable File  
Follow these steps to package the Python script into an executable:  

1. **Install PyInstaller:**  
   Ensure PyInstaller is installed in your Python environment:  
   ```bash  
   pip install pyinstaller  
   ```  

2. **Navigate to Your Script’s Directory:**  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and move to the folder containing the Python script. For example:  
   ```bash  
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\FocusLock  
   ```  

3. **Run PyInstaller Command:**  
   Generate the executable by running:  
   ```bash  
   python -m PyInstaller --onefile focus_lock.py  
   ```  
   This command creates a single executable file for distribution.  

4. **Locate the Executable:**  
   After the process completes, the executable can be found in the `dist` folder within your script's directory.  

5. **Run the Executable:**  
   Navigate to the `dist` folder and double-click the `.exe` file, or run it from the command prompt:  
   ```bash  
   cd dist  
   focus_lock.exe  
   ```  

By following these steps, Focus Lock becomes a user-friendly, portable application that provides seamless functionality akin to DeskPins, empowering users to manage their workspace efficiently.
